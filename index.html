    <p>Today I began the <em>Intro to Programming</em> on <a href="open.appacademy.io">App Academy Open</a>.
      In itself, that's not such a notable activity, but when I got to the part on "methods," I was left
      wondering why aren't those called procedures. It was quite a surprise to read the follow:
      <quote>"Many languages distinquish between functions, which have no associated
  object, and methods, which are invoked on a receiver object. Because
  Ruby is a purely object oriented language, all methods are true methods
  and are associated with at least one object."</quote>
